This is the relatively older version of combination and permutation algorithm implementation. This implementation used the 'pImplement' idiom, or 'design bu contract' principle. Yet the performance is not as great as the plain implementation, and, as combination and permutation has large complexity scale(n factorial scale), this can have big impact to the performance.

For better performance please refer to the seperate combination and permutation mordule, this module is kept here as a running repositoty for some related prototype algorithm development and study, while the seperate repository will be stable.
