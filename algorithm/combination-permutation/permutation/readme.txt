I designed and implemented this generic permutation generator which can generate any permutation(from P(n, 0) to P(n, n)) in lexigraphico order, either in index, or in permutated sequence. The performance of this algorithm is decent compared with std::next_permutation(about 6 to 8 times slower), but the std::next_permutaiton can only do P(n, n). There are some other permutation generators to choose if you just need do P(n, n). You could use C(n, k) and P(k, k) to simulate P(n, k), but, this is not in lexigraphico order. So, this algorithm is still useful for certain circumstances. Also, I think that, if STL library will include a similar P(n, k) function, its performance will not beat current std::next_permutation.
