This project is about data structure and algorithms about binary trees. The strong point of this implementation is that, the data structure and algorithm are seperated, if the data structure changes, like you can see from the code, DataStructure1 and DataStructure2 are totally different data structures, and Cartesian tree's data structure is even more different, the basic algorithms can be applied to all these data structures even without changing one single letter except for the variable name. Also this code provided an Eular Tour and some other operation's algorithm implementation.
