Algorithm to seperate an integer into all non-repetitive parts, which is called partition. 

The WIKI page about partition:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partition_(number_theory)

and an stackoverflow page:
Generating integer partition by its number

Besides the partition function that generates all partitions, I also developed next_partition and prev_partition functions, similar to the combination and permutation algorithms.
