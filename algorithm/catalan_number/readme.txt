In combinatorial mathematics, the Catalan numbers form a sequence of natural numbers that occur in various counting problems, often involving recursively-defined objects. They are named after the Belgian mathematician Eug¨¨ne Charles Catalan (1814¨C1894).
(As excerpted from Wikipedia: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalan_number)


Many counting problems, especially those have a 'order' in counting, are related with Catalan numbers, like pairing parenthesis, total number of Binary Search Trees formed by N unique nodes, the total pathes to travel from to from (0, 0) to (N, N) of a square without across the diagnal line, those listed in Wikipedia, etc. It is important in mathematics, and also, it's a good example in recursive programming. 


I tried to use as many as possible methods to fully explore Catalan number and its applicatoins. There are still something to be done with this problem, Most notablely, check a catalan sequence's serial number, and generate a catalan sequence from serial number, and prev_catalan, and next_catalan methods, and, some matching from Catalan number to some applications. Am going to do it later......
