In combinatorial mathematics, the Catalan numbers form a sequence of natural numbers that occur in various counting problems, often involving recursively-defined objects. They are named after the Belgian mathematician Eug¨¨ne Charles Catalan (1814¨C1894).
(As excerpted from Wikipedia: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalan_number)


Catalan number is important in mathematics, many counting problems, especially those have a 'order' in counting, are related with Catalan numbers, like pairing parenthesis, total number of Binary Search Trees formed by N unique nodes, the total pathes to travel from to from (0, 0) to (N, N) of a square without across the diagnal line, those listed in Wikipedia, etc.


I tried to use multiple methods to fully explore Catalan number and its applicatoins, besides usual recursive methods, I also designed and implemented prev_ and next_ methods like std::next_permutation.
