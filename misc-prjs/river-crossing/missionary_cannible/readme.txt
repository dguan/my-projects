This missionaries and cannibles river-crossing problem is a classical AI problem. The original problem statement is like this:

On one bank of a river are three missionaries and three cannibals.There is one boat available that can hold up to two people and that they would like to use to cross the river.If the cannibals ever outnumber the missionaries on either of the river???¡¥s banks, the missionaries will get eaten.
How can the boat be used to safely carry all the missionaries and cannibals across the river ?
(please refer to WIKI: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missionaries_and_cannibals_problem)

I solved the above classic missionary-cannible problem with an improvement to deal with arbitrary number of missionaries and cannibles.

Also, I extended the classic problem, suppose that each missionary and cannible took different different time to row the boat across the river, try to find out optimal solution that takes least time.
