These are all classic AI problems, involving logic, rules, combination, solution-tree and solution-space, etc. All classic problems are very tiny in scale, missionary-cannibal problem have only 3 missionaries and 3 cannibals, and the boat's volume is only 2. bridge-torch problem you can have only at most 2 people to cross the bridge. Actually, the problem's complexity could increase dramatically fast with scale, too fast to be handled.

So, I extended some problems, and tried some new methods to solve the bigger and more complex problems.
