This implemented a Singleton Design Pattern Wrapper template class, this wrapper class guarentees that, by using its GetInstance() method, it can turn any defaultly constructible classes into a singleton class. This means that, if you use its GetInstance() method, you will always get the ONE and ONLY ONE instance of that class. And, this wrapper class also guarentees to work perfectly correct under multi-threaded environments.
