This implemented the Subject and Observer Design Pattern Wrapper template class, this wrapper class is capable of multi subject to multi observer mapping, which means that one subject can be mapped to multiple observer, and one observer can watch multiple subjects. To be noted that, this wrapper class does not guarentee any multi-threading safety, it will at least need a mutex/lock_guard to guard the subject and observer container operations such as Attach/Detach and Register/Unregister, etc. It is not included in this version.
